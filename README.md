# **This Project is created using React Redux**

### Stories to implement

- Users dont need to log into the app
- Users can add new ingredients into a pantry. Each ingredient have a name and quantity (a simple number).
- Users can add or remove ingredients from the pantry.
- User can add a recipe to a list. Each recipe contains:

- **a list of ingredients including the quantity needed for each ingredient**
- **a method (just plain text)**
- **a “Cook” button which consumes ingredients from the pantry**
- **As a user, I can remove recipes from the list**
- **As a user, I can review at any time:**
-  **which recipe I cooked, when, and which ingredients were used**
- **the list of ingredients remaining in my pantry**
- **if you have time: persist the list of recipes to local storage and ensure it gets loaded when the app launches**
